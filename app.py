        ### üìò About This Dashboard

        This dashboard was developed to provide policymakers, researchers, and students with an interactive way to explore Sri Lanka‚Äôs labor market and social protection landscape using curated indicators from the World Bank.

        It organizes the data into four key areas:

        - üë∑ Unemployment & Labor Participation  
        - üè≠ Employment by Sector  
        - üõ°Ô∏è Social Protection Coverage  
        - üìâ Poverty Reduction Impact  

        Users can filter by theme, choose specific indicators, adjust year ranges, and select chart types (line, bar, scatter, box) to gain insights into how Sri Lanka‚Äôs workforce and welfare policies have evolved over time.

        üìä The dashboard also provides key summary statistics and the ability to download filtered data for further analysis.

            **Key Observations from the Data:**  
            - üìà The labor force participation rate has remained above 50% since 2000, but unemployment continues to fluctuate.  
            - üè≠ Employment has gradually shifted from agriculture to services, showing signs of structural transformation.  
            - üõ°Ô∏è Social protection coverage is consistently higher in urban areas than rural, reflecting unequal program reach.
